* List Marker

That little dot is a List Marker. These little visual denotations to literally mark a List item, inside a list. They can be different in shape or form, like alpha-numeric characters, symbols such as discs / dashes, and even custom characters (if you so wish it to be).

And this is all great, and to most, this level of basic customisation out of the box for a list would be enough. But is it though? 🤔 For years, Developers would provide a <i>hack</i> in CSS to remove the List Marker, style something in it's place, and override it. 

### List structure

Let's take a look at it: 🔍

```html
<ul>List:
   <li>List item
</ul>
```
